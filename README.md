```

## Get your Application Id

Sign up for [Kommunicate](https://dashboard.kommunicate.io) to get your [APP_ID](https://dashboard.kommunicate.io/settings/install). This APP_ID is used to create/launch conversations.

## Launch chat

Kommunicate provides buildConversation function to create and launch chat directly saving you the extra steps of authentication, creation, initialization and launch. You can customize the process by building the conversationObject according to your requirements.
To launch the chat you need to create a conversation object. This object is passed to the `buildConversation` function and based on the parameters of the object the chat is created/launched.

Below are some examples to launch chat in different scenarios:

### Launching chat for visitor:

If you would like to launch the chat directly without the visiting user entering any details, then use the method as below:

```dart
try {
     dynamic conversationObject = {
         'appId': '<APP_ID>' // The [APP_ID](https://dashboard.kommunicate.io/settings/install) obtained from kommunicate dashboard.
     };
      dynamic result = await KommunicateFlutterPlugin.buildConversation(conversationObject);
      print("Conversation builder success : " + result.toString());
    } on Exception catch (e) {
      print("Conversation builder error occurred : " + e.toString());
    }
```

### Launching chat for visitor with lead collection:

If you need the user to fill in details like phone number, emailId and name before starting the support chat then launch the chat with `withPreChat` flag as true. In this case you wouldn't need to pass the kmUser. A screen would open up for the user asking for details like emailId, phone number and name. Once the user fills the valid details (atleast emailId or phone number is required), the chat would be launched. Use the function as below:

```dart
try {
     dynamic conversationObject = {
         'appId': '<APP_ID>',// The [APP_ID](https://dashboard.kommunicate.io/settings/install) obtained from kommunicate dashboard.
         'withPreChat': true
      };
      dynamic result = await KommunicateFlutterPlugin.buildConversation(conversationObject);
      print("Conversation builder success : " + result.toString());
    } on Exception catch (e) {
      print("Conversation builder error occurred : " + e.toString());
    }
```

### Launching chat with existing user:

If you already have the user details then create a KMUser object using the details and launch the chat. Use the method as below to create KMUser with already existing details:

```dart
try {
     dynamic user = {
       'userId' : '<USER_ID>',   //Replace it with the userId of the logged in user
       'password' : '<PASSWORD>'  //Put password here if user has password, ignore otherwise
     };
     dynamic conversationObject = {
         'appId': '<APP_ID>',// The [APP_ID](https://dashboard.kommunicate.io/settings/install) obtained from kommunicate dashboard.
         'kmUser': jsonEncode(user)
      };
      dynamic result = await KommunicateFlutterPlugin.buildConversation(conversationObject);
      print("Conversation builder success : " + result.toString());
    } on Exception catch (e) {
      print("Conversation builder error occurred : " + e.toString());
    }
```

> Note: `jsonEncode` requires the dart package `dart:convert`. Make sure you have imported the package at the top of the dart file as `import 'dart:convert';`

If you have a different use-case and would like to customize the chat creation, user creation and chat launch, you can use more parameters in the conversationObject.

Below are all the parameters you can use to customize the conversation according to your requirements:

## Send data to bot platform

You can set the data you want to send to the bot platform by calling the `updateChatContext` method as below:

```dart
  dynamic chatContext = {
          'key': 'value',
          'objKey': {
            'objKey1' : 'objValue1',
            'objKey2' : 'objValue2'
          }
        };

  KommunicateFlutterPlugin.updateChatContext(chatContext);
```

## Update logged in user's details

You can update some details of the logged in user like displayName, imageUrl, metadata etc. Use the `updateUserDetail` method as below (Remove the fields from the userDetails object below, which you don't want to update):

```dart
try {
  dynamic userDetails = {
          'displayName': '<New Name>',
          'imageLink': '<new-image-url>',
          'email': '<New-Email>',
          'contactNumber': '<New-Contact-Number>'
          'metadata': {
            'objKey1' : 'objValue1',
            'objKey2' : 'objValue2'
          }
        };

  KommunicateFlutterPlugin.updateUserDetail(userDetails);
  } on Exception catch (e) {
      print("Error occured while updating userDetails : " + e.toString());
 }
```

Note: `userId`is a unique identifier of a kmUser object. It cannot be updated.

## Logout

You can call the `logout` method to logout the user from kommunicate. Use the method as below:

```dart
  KommunicateFlutterPlugin.logout();
```

Here is the sample app which implements this SDK: https://github.com/Kommunicate-io/Kommunicate-Flutter-Plugin/tree/master/example
